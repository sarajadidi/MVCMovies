    <p>Hello! As someone who enjoys watching movies with others as well as showing others
    movies that I adore, I decided to create this movie generator to help those in need...
    of picking a movie without entering an hour long discussion over whether or not to
    start a Horror movie or a Thriller, or which Harry Potter movie trumps the others,
    or Star Wars or any other series. After having many discussions with my friends over
    and over again, I created a solution. From here you can navigate to the Movie Generator
    tab where you can choose a genre and only a genre to generate a random movie. And
    although this will help you  come up with a random movie, it is still between you and
    your friends if you decide to watch it. </p>
    <h2>Good Luck!</h2>
